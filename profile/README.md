## For developers

### Jacdac device and service catalogs

The Jacdac [device](https://jacdac.github.io/jacdac-docs/devices/) and [service]((https://jacdac.github.io/jacdac-docs/services/) )
catalogs are the foundation of the Jacdac stack. 
The [jacdac/jacdac](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac)
repo contains the source of the catalogs, from which a variety
of other artifacts are generated. 

### Jacdac web stack

Jacdac bridges the world of the web browser and hardware via
the Jacdac bus, which you can experience via the [Jacdac dashboard](https://jacdac.github.io/jacdac-docs/dashboard). 
Device twins show the state of the connected
hardware; device simulators allow virtual devices to be added
to the bus.  The following repos define the web stack
- [jacdac/jacdac-ts](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-ts): dependency-free Jacdac Object Model (JDOM)
- [jacdac/jacdac-docs](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-docs): Jacdac home page and web-based tools
- [jacdac/react-jacdac](https://github.com/jacdac/react-jacdac): TBD

Jacdac firmware is organized into several repos:
- [jacdac/jacdac-c](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c):
